# Abstract
Data Science for All has for four cohorts per year on educating and empowering minorities, who want to gain experience in Data Science. In the Fall cohort, I was part of a new cohort that provide a way of a working professional in the field. The focus of this cohort was to build upon your skills from your day job. The cohort advisors were there to give us guidance on to build our presentation and how to minimize mistakes from trying new methods. From week to week, we chatted with each other to learn how others in the cohort were building their presentation. At the end, we created a presentation deck which, we made a presentation video for the cohort to view. 


# Summary of Skills

This is a preview of the Retail Challenge Presentation for Data Analysts.


# Findings
My task was to discuss trends that correlated with purchasing trends, KPIs, and the retention rate of three consumer segments. The data did show that between 2016 to 2017 had profit margins, sales, and retention rates. The most profitable segment was the consumer segment, and the home office was the least profitable. Overall, the data showed the consumer segment should always be seen as a top priority when it comes to higher sales. 



# Challenges
The challenge for this retail challenge was looking at the different data sets that were given to us. Within those data sets, we had to find trends that correlated with each other. Also, finding trends that would help us tell the story of the consumer segments. This whole process was done in a short amount of time, reflecting the professional work setting. 


# Conclusion
The presentation deck and presentation video were to inform the Data Science for All cohort about the discovered trends.  After conveying the trends, provide a few recommendations on which consumer segment to focus on. In all the findings, the consumer segment was the most profitable segment and finding way to keep their attention during the holiday season will need to a top priority.  It was great to go through the data and provide a summary of the trends to the cohort.
